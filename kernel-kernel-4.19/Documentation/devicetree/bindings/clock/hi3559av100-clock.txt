* Hisilicon Hi3559AV100 Clock Controller

The Hi3559AV100 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the HI3559AV100 SoC.

- compatible: the compatible should be one of the following strings to
  indicate the clock controller functionality. Should be one of the following.

  - "hisilicon,hi3559av100-clock"
  - "hisilicon,hi3559av100-shub-clock"

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: Should be <1>.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hi3559av100-clock.h>.

Examples:

	clock: clock0 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3559av100-clock", "syscon";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0x12010000 0x0 0x10000>;
	};

	uart0: uart@12100000 {
		compatible = "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0x12100000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clock HI3559AV100_UART0_CLK>;
		clock-names = "apb_pclk";
	};
